# Global Temperature Data Analysis

This program analyzes global temperature data and provides insights into the temperature change trends over time. The program uses a Streamlit web application to display the analysis results.

## Requirements

To run this program, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- Streamlit

You can install these libraries using the following command:

    pip install numpy matplotlib scipy streamlit

## Usage

To run the program, navigate to the directory containing the global_temp_analysis.py file and run the following command:

    streamlit run app.py
 
This will launch the Streamlit web application in your web browser. You can interact with the application by adjusting the year slider to select the year for which you want to view the temperature data analysis.

The program will display the following information for the selected year:

- Optimized parameters of the temperature trend function
- Error estimate of the temperature trend function
- A plot of the temperature data and the best fit model for the selected year
- The lowest temperature anomaly according to the best fit model
- The average temperature anomaly for the selected year
- The slope of the temperature anomaly trend for the selected year

## Conclusion

This program provides a useful tool for analyzing global temperature data and understanding the trends and patterns of temperature change over time. The analysis highlights the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
